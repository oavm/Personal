In this folder you find the code you need to run for the Mini Project 1. The main file is called:

“RunRobotDynamics.m”

Note:

- The method used for integration uses variable sampling time, which means that you need to accommodate for that when you make animations or plots of the data.

- You can change all parts of the code I provide you, so you can construct your own integration methods, etc.

- You can convert this code to other languages if you want. No special Matlab functions are used, so conversion should be very simple.
