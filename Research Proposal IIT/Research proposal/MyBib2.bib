abstract = {—This paper presents a unified approach for inverseand direct dynamics of constrained multibody systems that can serve as a basis for analysis, simulation, and control. The main advantage of the dynamics formulation is that it does not require the constraint equations to be linearly independent. Thus, a simulation may proceed even in the presence of redundant constraints or singular configurations, and a controller does not need to change its structure whenever the mechanical system changes its topology or number of degrees of freedom. A motion-control scheme is proposed based on a projected inverse-dynamics scheme which proves to be stable and minimizes the weighted Euclidean norm of the actuation force. The projection-based control scheme is further developed for constrained systems, e.g., parallel manipulators, which have some joints with no actuators (passive joints). This is complemented by the development of constraint force control. A condition on the inertia matrix resulting in a decoupled mechanical system is analytically derived that simplifies the implementation of the force control. Finally, numerical and experimental results obtained from dynamic simulation and control of constrained mechanical systems, based on the proposed inverse and direct dynamics formulations, are documented.

abstract = {Online trajectory generation for robots with multiple degrees of freedom is still a difficult and unsolved problem, in particular for non-steady state locomotion, that is, when the robot has to move in a complex environment with continuous variations of the speed, direction, and type of locomotor behavior. In this article we address the problem of controlling the non-steady state swimming and crawling of a novel fish robot. For this, we have designed a control architecture based on a central pattern generator (CPG) implemented as a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators. The CPG, like its biological counterpart, can produce coordinated patterns of rhythmic activity while being modulated by simple control parameters. To test our controller, we designed BoxyBot, a simple fish robot with three actuated fins capable of swimming in water and crawling on firm ground. Using the CPG model, the robot is capable of performing and switching between a variety of different locomotor behaviors such as swimming forwards, swimming backwards, turning, rolling, moving upwards/downwards, and crawling. These behaviors are triggered and modulated by sensory input provided by light, water, and touch sensors. Results are presented demonstrating the agility of the robot and interesting properties of a CPG-based control approach such as stability of the rhythmic patterns due to limit cycle behavior, and the production of smooth trajectories despite abrupt changes of control parameters. The robot is currently used in a temporary 20-month long exhibition at the EPFL. We present the hardware setup that was designed for the exhibition, and the type of interactions with the control system that allow visitors to influence the behavior of the robot. The exhibition is useful to test the robustness of the robot for long term use, and to demonstrate the suitability of the CPG-based approach for interactive control with a human in the loop. This article is an extended version of an article presented at BioRob2006 the first IEEE/RAS-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics.},
