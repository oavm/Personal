This report will go through the following topics:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Derivation of the closed loop error dynamics for the 3D directional drilling system using output-feedback controller}. Sections 1 and 2 of the document are the corrected version of the error dynamics and the linearization. They are the same as in the previous report, but with the changes made based on the remarks from our last meeting.
	\item \textbf{Controller Design}. This section shows the results of the proposed controller design with the changes made on the remarks on comments from our last meeting.
	\item \textbf{Robust stability analysis} This section starts with the derivation of the error dynamics for the system including parameter uncertainty. The analysis and results is not complete yet.
	\item \textbf{Questions} The last part of the document contains two questions that I ran into while working.
\end{enumerate}
