abstract = {The dynamical model governing the 3D kinematics of a drill bit is constructed for rotary drilling applications for which the bit is guided by a push-the-bit rotary steerable system. The evolution of the bit trajectory, and thus of the borehole geometry, is a consequence of the interaction between the borehole, a geometric object, and the drilling structure, a mechanical object. In this respect, the model describing this evolution consists of the association between (i) a model of the near-bit region of the drillstring, (ii) a model of the bit/rock interaction, and (iii) kinematic relationships relating the motion of the bit into the rock to geometric variables for the borehole evolution. The mathematical formulation of these three elements yields a set of functional differential equations with secular terms accounting for a delayed influence of the borehole geometry on the bit trajectory. The parameters entering these relations account for the loads and properties of the drilling structure and for the properties of the bit and rock formation. Three length scales are identified in the response of the directional drilling system; they correspond to short-, intermediate-, and long-range behaviors. The short-range response is associated with the dimensions of the bit, the small scale of the problem. It corresponds to fast variations of the bit orientation. On the intermediate-range, the wellbore trajectory converges to a quasi-constant curvature solution, if it is stable. On the long-range, the borehole curvature slowly varies and for appropriate set of drilling parameters the borehole converges toward a stationary helical path. Finally, the stability and rate of convergence on the intermediate and long range are investigated.},

abstract = {Directional drilling has become increasingly important as a means for better exploitation of oil and gas reservoirs as well as part of a drive to increase the level of automation in the industry. Typically a well plan is created for a variety of reasons, such as maximizing productive drilling, minimizing well tortuosity, collision avoidance or navigating the tool to strategic points within a pay zone. Following a nominal well plan created to satisfy these requirements whilst drilling leads to a clear requirement for automated trajectory controlled drilling. This paper builds on the authorsâ earlier work on generalized attitude control of directional drilling to develop a path following algorithm incorporating optimized geometric Hermite space curves as a means of generating the correction path from the instantaneous tool position to the well plan trajectory whilst minimizing the drill string strain energy. The proposed scheme is tested in simulation and shown to perform satisfactorily for a typical set of drilling operating parameters for converging towards a target position and attitude.},

@article{Matheus2014,
abstract = {Traditionally, trajectory control in the drilling industry has been performed by experienced directional drillers, using drilling tools such as mud motors, these tools are just iron components, that limits the efficiency of the drilling process and rate of penetration (ROP). The introduction of Rotary Steerable Systems (RSS) enabled faster and efficient well bore delivery. This tested the limits of human operators to assimilate the MWD data, compare the actual well trajectory with the planned and take corrective actions to get back to the desire well plan. A hybrid approach consisting of two levels is proposed to perform the trajectory control in the oil drilling industry using RSS. Level 1, attitude control, regulates inclination and azimuth downhole. Level 2, the outer loop, monitors the performance of the inner loop and controls the directional drilling commands issued to the tool to follow a predefined plan. A next generation nonlinear trajectory control algorithm was developed and tested. This algorithm can hold inclination and azimuth downhole, run below mud motors, and perform an automatic turn, while holding inclination with the ability to control the gains while drilling ahead. This novel algorithm has been applied in various locations worldwide to control inclination and azimuth and keep true vertical depth (TVD) within tight tolerances. Conclusions and lessons learned from the analysis will aid future applications of the hybrid approach and the new algorithm. Copyright 2014, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

The program can be used to simulate directional wells program can be used to simulate directional wells that have been drilled, or to predict the actual trajectory for a given bottom-hole assembly, geology, and operating conditions.
The logic for the simulation program is presented, discussing how the bottom-hole assembly presented, discussing how the bottom-hole assembly program, and the bit and stabilizer side cutting data program, and the bit and stabilizer side cutting data were merged to form the basis of the program. Various inputs for a simulation or prediction, and the sensitivity of each input, are discussed. Mechanisms that are not included in the algorithm are cited, explaining how the lack of these mechanisms precluded the simulation of a certain variety of precluded the simulation of a certain variety of directional wells.
Results from the simulation of a directional well drilled in Holland are presented. Matching of actual inclination and direction data provided the basis of showing how the program could be used in a predictive mode for the selection and operation of predictive mode for the selection and operation of other bottom-hole assemblies for drilling another directional well in the same area.
A final section discusses some of the problems encountered in running simulations and how these problems equate to actual field conditions. problems equate to actual field conditions. Mechanisms that need to be added to the algorithm to increase the fidelity and the breath of the simulation are mentioned.
The existing program has been used successfully to match wellbore trajectories in areas where the geological effects are nil to moderate and the wellbore conditions can be accurately described. With further refinements and enhancements to the program, it will only be a matter of time before any directional or deviation control well can be simulated. This ultimately means a computer program can be used to aid the drilling person in making sound engineering decisions on how to drill a directional well. },

Without them, there is extra risk of undesirable deviation which can cause severe drilling problems and greatly increase the cost of drilling. This paper presents the analytical basis and field applications of an integrated computer method in directional drilling. The method includes two-dimensional BRA bending analysis for designing BHAs and predicting their deviation tendencies, and a heuristic formation-bit interaction model for forecasting the future wellbore position while drilling. Using this computer method, parametric studies are performed on several single and multi-stabilizer bottom hole assemblies to demonstrate the effects of stabilizer placement and wear, WOB (weight on bit), hole angle, and borehole current curvature on the deviation tendency of these assemblies. Predicted wellbore positions from the drilling ahead model are compared with actual field data for two directional wells.},

@article{Burke2005,
abstract = {Let f be a continuous function on {\$}\backslashRl{\^{}}n{\$}, and suppose f is continuously differentiable on an open dense subset. Such functions arise in many applications, and very often minimizers are points at which f is not differentiable. Of particular interest is the case where f is not convex, and perhaps not even locally Lipschitz, but is a function whose gradient is easily computed where it is defined. We present a practical, robust algorithm to locally minimize such functions, based on gradient sampling. No subgradient information is required by the algorithm. When f is locally Lipschitz and has bounded level sets, and the sampling radius {\$}\backslasheps{\$} is fixed, we show that, with probability 1, the algorithm generates a sequence with a cluster point that is Clarke {\$}\backslasheps{\$}-stationary. Furthermore, we show that if f has a unique Clarke stationary point {\$}\backslashbar x{\$}, then the set of all cluster points generated by the algorithm converges to {\$}\backslashbar x{\$} as {\$}\backslasheps{\$} is reduced to zero. Numerical results are presented demonstrating the robustness of the algorithm and its applicability in a wide variety of contexts, including cases where f is not locally Lipschitz at minimizers. We report approximate local minimizers for functions in the applications literature which have not, to our knowledge, been obtained previously. When the termination criteria of the algorithm are satisfied, a precise statement about nearness to Clarke {\$}\backslasheps{\$}-stationarity is available. A MATLAB implementation of the algorithm is posted at http://www.cs.nyu.edu/overton/papers/gradsamp/alg.},

Focusing on practical feedback control and not on system theory in general, this book provides the reader with insights into the opportunities and limitations of feedback control.Taking into account the latest developments in the field, this fully revised and updated second edition:* features a new chapter devoted to the use of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs);* presents current results on fundamental performance limitations introduced by RHP-poles and RHP-zeros;* introduces updated material on the selection of controlled variables and self-optimizing control;* provides simple IMC tuning rules for PID control;* covers additional material including unstable plants, the feedback amplifier, the lower gain margin and a clear strategy for incorporating integral action into LQG control;* includes numerous worked examples, exercises and case studies, which make frequent use of Matlab and the new Robust Control toolbox.Multivariable Feedback Control: Analysis and Design, Second Edition is an excellent resource for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses studying multivariable control. It is also an invaluable tool for engineers who want to understand multivariable control, its limitations, and how it can be applied in practice. The analysis techniques and the material on control structure design should prove very useful in the new emerging area of systems biology.Reviews of the first edition:"Being rich in insights and practical tips on controller design, the book should also prove to be very beneficial to industrial control engineers, both as a reference book and as an educational tool." Applied Mechanics Reviews"In summary, this book can be strongly recommended not only as a basic text in multivariable control techniques for graduate and undergraduate students, but also as a valuable source of information for control engineers."

@article{Park2015,
abstract = {This paper presents a bio-inspired quadruped controller that allows variable-speed galloping. The controller design is inspired by observations from biological runners. Quadrupedal animals increase the vertical impulse that is generated by ground reaction forces at each stride as running speed increases and the duration of each stance phase reduces, whereas the swing phase stays relatively constant. Inspired by this observation, the presented controller estimates the required vertical impulse at each stride by applying the linear momentum conservation principle in the vertical direction and prescribes the ground reaction forces at each stride. The design process begins with deriving a planar model from the MIT Cheetah 2 robot. A baseline periodic limit cycle is obtained by optimizing ground reaction force profiles and the temporal gait pattern (timing and duration of gait phases). To stabilize the optimized limit cycle, the obtained limit cycle is converted to a state feedback controller by representing the obtained ground reaction force profiles as functions of the state variable, which is monotonically increasing throughout the gait, adding impedance control around the height and pitch trajectories of the obtained limit cycle and introducing a finite state machine and a pattern stabilizer to enforce the optimized gait pattern. The controller that achieves a stable 3 m s â1 gallop successfully adapts the speed change by scaling the vertical ground reaction force to match the momentum lost by gravity and adding a simple speed controller that controls horizontal speed. Without requiring additional gait optimization processes, the controller achieves galloping at speeds ranging from 3 m s â1 to 14.9 m s â1 while respecting the torque limit of the motor used in the MIT Cheetah 2 robot. The robustness of the controller is verified by demonstrating stable running during various disturbances, including 1.49 m step down and 0.18 m step up, as well as random ground height and model parameter variations.},

@article{Asif2011,
abstract = {This paper aims to solve a major drawback of walking robots i.e. their inability to react to environmental disturbances while navigating in natural rough terrains. This problem is reduced here by suggesting the use of a hybrid forceâposition control based trajectory generation with the impact dynamics into consideration that compensates for the stability variations, thus helping the robot react stably in the face of environmental disturbances. As a consequence, the proposed impactâbased hybrid control helps the robot achieve better and stable motion planning than conventional positionâbased control algorithms. Dynamic simulations and real world outdoor experiments performed on a six legged hexapod robot show a relevant improvement in the robot locomotion.},

abstract = {We propose a reactive controller framework for robust quadrupedal locomotion, designed to cope with terrain irregularities, trajectory tracking errors and poor state estimation. The framework comprises two main modules: One related to the generation of elliptic trajectories for the feet and the other for control of the stability of the whole robot. We propose a task space CPG-based trajectory generation that can be modulated according to terrain irregularities and the posture of the robot trunk. To improve the robot's stability, we implemented a null space based attitude control for the trunk and a push recovery algorithm based on the concept of capture points. Simulations and experimental results on the hydraulically actuated quadruped robot HyQ will be presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.},
