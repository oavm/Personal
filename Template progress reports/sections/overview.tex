This report will go through the following topics:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Error dynamics and linearization}. Sections 1 and 2 (error dynamics and linearization) are kept because some of the equations from this sections are referred to in the  new sections.
	\item \textbf{Controller Design}. Section 3 shows the controller design with the changes discussed in the last meeting.
	\item \textbf{Robust stability analysis} Section 4 and 5 includes the derivation of the error dynmaics of the system with uncertain active weight on bit and its linearization.
	\item \textbf{Robust controller design} Section 6 discusses the controller proposes in order to overcome uncertainty on $\Pi$.
\end{enumerate}
