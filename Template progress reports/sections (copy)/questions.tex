As for now, I have already performed the linearization of the system in matlab, although I have some questions regarding the stability analysis and the controller synthesis.

1.- After linearizing, I checked how the pole locations changed for several values of $\Pi$ in the linearized system. It seems that the controller already designed, as long as you are close to the linearization point, it is already pretty robust (I checked values from $\Pi = 6000$ to $\Pi = 20000$, nominal being $\Pi = 14000$). I will write down that part of the report during the weekend and show it to you during the meeting to check if what I did was correct.

2.- Regarding controller synthesis, the difference with the nominal case is that terms appear related to the error, the input and the integral action in the observer. But, if we do same analysis as before (all the perturbed states will go to zero if we are close to the linearization point), can we then design a controller for a grid of values of $\Pi$?
