abstract = {We present a new class of gait generation and control algorithms based on the switching max-plus modeling framework that allows for the synchronization of multiple legs of walking robots. Transitions between stance and swing phases of each leg are modeled as discrete events on a system described by max-plus-linear state equations. Different gaits and gait parameters can be interleaved by using different system matrices. Switching in max-plus-linear systems offers a powerful collection of modeling, analysis, and control tools that, in particular, allow for safe transitions between different locomotion gaits that may involve breaking/enforcing synchronization or changing the order of leg lift off events. Experimental validation of the proposed algorithms is presented by the implementation of various horse gaits on a simple quadruped robot.},
